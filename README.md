ls# Final Project Proposal
*High level summary of your project, including the things that* **you** *find interesting*
The purpose of this project will be to explore the recursive properties of
   fractals. I will be using L-systems and turtles, primarily to draw most of my fractals and attempt to use the Numba library in order to maximize time efficiency.

The L-systems will ideally be paired with instructions on the turtle library so
  that each recursive function is given drawing instructions. Additionally, the recursive functions will be customizable so that each instruction yields a different pattern and an additional argument will be the number of iterations the function goes through.

What I find interesting is the math behind fractals and how if you zoom in to a
 particular section of a fractal, it seems like its the original fractal. I also find the recursive nature of fractals and how they can be determined in terms of itself.


## Data Plan
*Summarize data sources, data formats, and how to obtain or generate the data you will be using*
The only data I would be involved with is simply reading about different kinds of
 fractals and more on L-systems but I wouldn't be opening data with CSV.

## Implementation Plan
*Overview of your plan. Are you starting from existing code? What skills from the course will be be using to complete your project? etc.*
I will be using prior knowledge of fractals and more recently acquired knowledge
  of recursive functions. Additionally, I will possibly be using the same code I've written before on the Cantor set and Mandlebrot set and modify it so that it will take different arguments of size and iterations.
